            Metaphysics is the study of the nature of reality, of what exists in the world, what it is like, and how it is ordered.In metaphysics philosophers wrestle with such questions as:

            Is there a God ?
            What is truth ?
            What is a person ? What makes a person the same through time ?
            Is the world strictly composed of matter ?
            Do people have minds ? If so, how is the mind related to the body ?
            Do people have free wills ?
            What is it for one event to cause another
