            Quite literally, the term "philosophy" means, "love of wisdom." In a broad sense, philosophy is an activity people undertake when they seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to each other. As an academic discipline philosophy is much the same. Those who study philosophy are perpetually engaged in asking, answering, and arguing for their answers to lifeâ€™s most basic questions.
            To make such a pursuit more systematic academic philosophy is traditionally divided into major areas of study.
            Philosophy is at its most fundamental in the study of metaphysics.
